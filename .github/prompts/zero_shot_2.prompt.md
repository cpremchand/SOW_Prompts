## Project Assumptions
This SOW encompasses only the Project Name identified in the Scope of Work section of this document. It does not include any other projects in which CFeynmanCompany is supporting with the Client.
CFeynmanCompany pricing does not include travel expenses related to the performance of this SOW. Travel expenses, if required, will be invoiced to Client at reasonable and actual rates and shall be payable in accordance with CFeynmanCompany payment terms as defined below in the Terms and Conditions. Travel expenses may include transportation, lodging, and/or meals. Additionally, CFeynmanCompany will bill compensable travel time as required by U.S. Federal law; compensable travel hours are not included in the project time estimates included in this SOW.


## Client Responsibilities
The CFeynmanCompany team resources will need the following:
Access to Client project management to review priorities, steer the project, attend status meetings, and approve project deliverables;
Access to and cooperation from Client Development, QA, IT, and Business resources;
Access to all project documentation, including, but not limited to, business and functional; requirements, systems architecture and design, use cases, etc. necessary for proper automation and performance test strategy development;
Uninterrupted access to the correct version of the software every weekday (and weekends if required) for the duration of the project.
Client will provide all appropriate work environment needs and infrastructure (Test and Production).
All access and connectivity issues are resolved by the start date; at that time, all team members must have unfettered access to all required resources.

Except in connection with Services expressly anticipating any such action, neither Party shall interpret, reverse-engineer, decompile, disassemble, debug or otherwise use any part of software, to which it is given access in connection with the Services, to access or generate corresponding higher-level code, or to access to logic intrinsic thereto; nor will it aid, abide or permit another to do so.

Maintenance of Confidential Information. Both Parties, with respect to the Confidential Information shall (i) maintain it in confidence; (ii) use at least the same degree of care in maintaining its secrecy as they use in maintaining the secrecy of their own proprietary, confidential and trade secret information, but in no event less than a reasonable degree of care; and (iii) use it only to fulfill their obligations under this SOW unless hereafter such further use is agreed to in writing by the other Party. 

Exchange of Confidential Information. Upon completion of the Services, or upon the disclosing Party’s earlier request, the receiving Party shall immediately give over to the disclosing Party all of the disclosing Party’s Confidential Information then in the receiving Party’s possession. Neither Party shall retain a part, or copy of any of the other’s Confidential Information and, if requested in writing, the receiving Party shall certify its exacting compliance with the foregoing provision.

Survival. The provisions of this Section shall survive the termination or expiration of this SOW and shall remain in effect so long as either Party has in its possession any Confidential Information.

Request for Disclosure. Both Parties acknowledge the competitive value and confidential nature of the Confidential Information. In the event that the receiving party becomes legally compelled to disclose any of the disclosing party’s Confidential Information, the receiving party shall provide the disclosing party with immediate notice so that the disclosing party may seek a protective order or other appropriate remedy and the receiving party agrees to cooperate in seeking reasonable protective arrangements requested by the disclosing party. If a protective order or other remedy to prevent disclosure is not obtained, the receiving party shall furnish only that portion of the Confidential Information which is legally required, and the receiving Party shall exercise its reasonable best efforts to obtain reasonable assurance that confidential treatment will be accorded the Confidential Information.

Remedies. Both Parties acknowledge and agree that, given the nature of the Confidential Information and the damage that may result if information contained therein is disclosed to any third Party, money damages may not be sufficient remedy for any breach of this SOW, and that, in addition to all other remedies, the non-breaching Party may be entitled to specific performance and injunctive or other equitable relief as deemed proper or necessary by a court of competent jurisdiction as a remedy for any such breach.

Exceptions. Neither Party shall have any obligation concerning any portion of the Confidential Information which (i) was at the time of disclosure or thereafter, (but prior to either Parties’ disclosure) in the public domain through no act or failure to act on the recipient Parties’ part, or (ii) was already in the recipient parties’ possession at the time of its disclosure and was not acquired directly or indirectly from the other Party, or (iii) was lawfully received by the recipient party after disclosure from a third party without obligation of confidentiality and without violation by such third party of an obligation of confidentiality to another, or (iv) was independently developed by the recipient party without any use of or benefit of Confidential Information, or (v) is approved in writing for release or disclosure by the disclosing Party without restriction. Neither party shall disclose any portion of the Confidential Information to any person except those of its employees having a need to know such portion to accomplish the purposes contemplated by this SOW, and strictly in accordance with the terms of this SOW. Both Parties represent that they have agreements in place with their employees and CFeynmanCompany which restrict the unauthorized disclosure or use of confidential and proprietary information of third Parties.

Without the prior written consent of the other Party, this SOW and all subsequent Change Orders may not be shown to any third parties other than the Client’s government regulators, CFeynmanCompany’s Affiliates, the Parties’ legal counsel and accountants, the Parties’ authorized employees and the Parties’ authorized agents and subcontractors under this SOW and all subsequent Change Orders. Notwithstanding the foregoing, this SOW and all subsequent Change Orders may be disclosed as necessary by reason of legal, accounting or regulatory requirements beyond the reasonable control of CFeynmanCompany or the Client, in which event CFeynmanCompany and the Client agree to exercise diligence in limiting such disclosure to the minimum amount necessary under the circumstances, or in any such case whereby CFeynmanCompany must demonstrate evidence of the business relationship in support of, but not limited to, processing procedures and/or petition filings.
